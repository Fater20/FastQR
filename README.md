# FastQR
## Introduction
We propose a new method to achieve fast pose estimation of objects based on multiple QR codes and monocular vision. We call it FastQR. Achieve 6DoF pose estimation of objects through post QR tag on them. You only need to know the relative positional relationship between the QR code and the object or ensure that any one QR code can be detected at the same time as another QR code.
We use the Apriltag as visual markers in this sample. You can also use other QR tags, for which you only need to replace the detection algorithm.
